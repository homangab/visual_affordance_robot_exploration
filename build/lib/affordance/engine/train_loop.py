class HookBase:
    """
    Base class for hooks that can be registered with :class:`TrainerBase`.

    Each hook can implement 4 methods. The way they are called is demonstrated
    in the following snippet:

    .. code-block:: python

        hook.before_train()
        for iter in range(start_iter, max_iter):
            hook.before_step()
            trainer.run_step()
            hook.after_step()
        hook.after_train()

    Notes:
        1. In the hook method, users can access `self.trainer` to access more
           properties about the context (e.g., current iteration).

        2. A hook that does something in :meth:`before_step` can often be
           implemented equivalently in :meth:`after_step`.
           If the hook takes non-trivial time, it is strongly recommended to
           implement the hook in :meth:`after_step` instead of :meth:`before_step`.
           The convention is that :meth:`before_step` should only take negligible time.

           Following this convention will allow hooks that do care about the difference
           between :meth:`before_step` and :meth:`after_step` (e.g., timer) to
           function properly.

    Attributes:
        trainer: A weak reference to the trainer object. Set by the trainer when the hook is
            registered.
    """

    def before_train(self):
        """
